                <p>"Growing up in the Loire Valley, 
                    Chef Galliot has been interested in cooking and travel since he was a child.

                     he is also constantly exploring flavours from around the world 
                     and incorporating them into his own dishes."</p>
                <p>"Food is emotional. 
                    It's an amazing feeling when you take a bite and feel 
                    that everything fits together perfectly."</p>
